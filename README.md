# Goal:
The goal of this project is to develop an autonomous system that can detect windows using a Tello drone and navigate through them using computer vision techniques. This system will utilize advanced image processing algorithms to identify windows in a variety of environments and autonomously guide the drone through them. By achieving this goal, the system will contribute to the development of new technologies for aerial navigation, as well as provide a practical solution for inspecting and maintaining windows in buildings and other structures.

The primary objectives of this project include:

1-Developing a robust computer vision model for window detection and recognition.
2-Implementing a navigation system that allows the drone to autonomously navigate through detected windows in a safe and efficient manner.
3-Evaluating the system's effectiveness in terms of accuracy, safety, and reliability.
By achieving these objectives, we aim to provide a proof-of-concept for a new type of aerial inspection and maintenance system.
